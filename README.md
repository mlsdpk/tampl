# Task and Motion Planning Library (TAMPL)

> **âš  Warning:** This library is still under development.

An all-in-one library for prototyping, benchmarking, and integrating task and motion planning algorithms into real-world systems, all powered by behavior trees.

## Building Instructions

### Prerequisites

Before building TAMPL from source, ensure that the necessary dependencies are installed.

**For Linux (Ubuntu/Debian)**
```bash
$ sudo apt install -y libboost-all-dev libeigen3-dev libzmq3-dev libsqlite3-dev
```

**For macOS (using Homebrew)**
```bash
$ brew install boost eigen zeromq sqlite
```

TAMPL also uses [CPM.cmake](https://github.com/cpm-cmake/CPM.cmake) to manage additional dependenices such as [BehaviorTree.CPP](https://github.com/BehaviorTree/BehaviorTree.CPP), [OMPL](https://github.com/ompl/ompl), and more. These dependencies can be found in [dependencies.cmake](cmake/dependencies.cmake). 

Now, run the following commands from the repository's top-level directory to build TAMPL from source. The first build may take some time as all necessary dependencies will be downloaded and compiled.

```bash
$ mkdir build && cd build
$ cmake ..
$ make -j$(nproc)
```

## Running Examples

All the examples demonstrating TAMPL's capabilities can be found in the [examples](examples/).
